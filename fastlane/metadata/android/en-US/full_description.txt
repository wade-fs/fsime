This keyboard app lets you input Chinese characters by typing stroke sequences (e.g. 天 is ㇐㇐㇒㇔).

It is a minimalist implementation with the following features:

* Good character support (over 28k characters) including vernacular Cantonese
* User preference for traditional or simplified characters
* No ads
* No permissions
* No tracking or telemetry
* Deterministic candidate generation which doesn't learn user input

After installing the app, launch and follow the prompts to enable Stroke Input Method in your system settings. There will be a default warning shown — this is normal.
